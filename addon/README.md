# Unity-Addons
Repository of Addons for [Unity Installer](https://github.com/Zackptg5/Unity).

## Usage:
- In the root of your unity installer zip, make an "addon" folder
- Copy the addons of choice from this repo into the created addon folder
- Ex: addons/APK-Patcher
- Read the README in each repo addon folder for usage
- Don't delete/modify anything in the addon folder unless readme says otherwise
- Note that you can compress the addon folder into a tar.xz file to save space.

To compress to a tar.xz file, you can use the command `tar -xJf addon.tar.xz addon` from terminal or if using Windows, install [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) and compress the folder to addon.tar and then compress addon.tar to addon.tar.xz with ultra compression.
